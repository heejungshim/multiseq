Title: multi-scale Poisson process approach for differential expression analysis or association analysis of high-throughput sequencing data
Version: 0.1.3
Date: 2021-06-06
Description: multi-scale Poisson process approach for differential expression analysis or association analysis of high-throughput sequencing data. It estimates and tests for differences (or associations) in the high-throughput sequencing data across samples. The algorithms implement the methods described Shim et al, 2021.
