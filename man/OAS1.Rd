\title{A list containing counts, covariates and metadata from a RNA-Seq experiment
with a pattern of differential expression.}
\format{A list with elements: \code{x} a 66 by 2^12 matrix of counts, \code{read.depth}
a 66-dimensional vector specifiying the total number of counts per sample, a string \code{SNP}
specifying the SNP name, \code{g} a 66-dimensional vector specifying the genotype (covariate)
for each sample, \code{assembly} specifying the genome that reads were mapped to,
\code{region} a string specifying the region of length 2^12 that reads were mapped to.}
\description{
This is a subset of the data collected in an RNA-Seq experiment on
lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from unrelated Nigerian individuals (Pickrell et al.,
Nature 464, 768-772, 2010). Specifically, it consists of a matrix of counts for 66
samples over a region of length 2^12 (chr12:113354417-113358512) where SNP rs10774671
was found to be associated with a differential expression pattern. Reads were
downloaded from http://eqtl.uchicago.edu/Home.html amd mapped to \code{hg19} with bwa;
read counts were extracted from the bam files with function \code{\link{get.counts}}.
Covariates (genotypes) are available from the International HapMap Project.
